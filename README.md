Thoughts before project...

## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?
```md
I was thinking of creating an application that allows a user to add players to a baseball team roster.
This would be an alpha stage of a more in depth project I would like to pursue later on or after the program.
```

## Write between 3-5 user stories
We have gone over this before. Please refer to your notes, previous repos or the
google machine if you need further assistance.
```md
As a user, I want to be able to create a baseball team.
As a user, I want to be able to add players to said team, including full name and position
As a user I want to be able to add players to a starting line-up.
```

## Plan your tables and columns
What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?
```md
I will need a team table, a players table, a position id table.
Columns could include name, skill level, hometown and position.
```

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)
These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another
(one to many, many to many, etc).
Include an image (or a link to image) below.
```md
See wireframe project 2 draft.jpeg
```

## Routing
What routes will you need to make the proper request to your API?
```md
not sure at the moment
```

## 3rd Party APIs
Do you plan to use any, if so what are they?
```md
not sure at this point
```

## Wireframes
Please create a wireframe of your planned front end.
```md
See wireframe project 2 draft.jpeg
```

## Timetable
Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.
```md
1-2 days lesson review, 1-2 project planning, 1-2 days backend dev, 1-2 front-end dev.
```
Thoughts after project...
1. Take things slow, 1 problem at a time, 1 task at a time.
2. Work horizontally not vertically
3. Keep a tight schedule
  1. Issue queue until it hurts, then it won't hurt.
  2. Try to get sleep, so 9-11 am = no distractions && good work rhythm.
4. Ask a friend.
5. Stay positive. Everthing's gonna be alright!
```
